# Snakeware
Snakeware is a app runtime.

## Running Snakeware
### Windows + Linux

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/TheRealInkDevil/snakeware.git`
2. Run `sw.py`

## Dependencies
Snakeware only requires a functioning installation of Python.

## TODO
- Implement installing and removing swapps
- Move the builtin swapps to their own repos
- Allow apps to have code entrypoints
- Completely decouple gbe-fork and Steamless
- Add a good update system
